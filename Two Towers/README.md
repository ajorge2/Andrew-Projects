Created a program that optimally builds two towers from uniquely sized cubic blocks to achieve nearly equal heights. 
Worked with a SubsetIterator class, a generic Iterator that iterates through all possible subsets of any given list, and created a TwoTowers class to iterate through subsets of block heights, identifying the tallest possible tower that's no taller than half the total height.
