\f0\fs24 \cf0 1.  The best solution is using blocks 2 4 5 6 7 8 10 11 12 13 14 15.\
2. 20 block: 1700 ms, 21 block: 2000 ms, 22 block: 3000 ms. The run times are growing exponentially. This makes sense because the big O of many of my classes is exponential.\
3. Since the difference in run time of a number n and n + 1 seems to roughly triple from the last difference of n-1 and n, I would estimate that the runtime of n = 50 would be approximately 2000 + (1000 * 3^(50-21)), or 6.86 * 10^16 ms or 6.86 * 10^13 seconds. }
